- **GPU Computing**: CUDA, RTX 4070 optimization
- **Financial Data**: SEC filings, Financial news datasets

### Key Components

#### 1. Financial Feature Extractor
```python
# Fraud indicators detected
fraud_indicators = {
    'uncertainty': ['may', 'might', 'allegedly'],
    'secrecy': ['confidential', 'insider', 'exclusive'],
    'urgency': ['urgent', 'immediate', 'deadline'],
    'vague_sources': ['sources say', 'rumors', 'unnamed']
}
```

#### 2. LSTM Model Architecture
